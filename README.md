    * Contact information (email, phone, address).
    * Social media links.
    * An interactive contact form (requires backend integration for functionality).

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the core structure of the web pages.
* **CSS3:** For styling and responsive design.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** For interactive elements, specifically the hero carousel functionality and mobile navigation toggle.
* **(Optional: Swiper.js):** The previous version included Swiper.js for the product carousel. While the current product section is a static grid, Swiper.js can be easily reintroduced for a sliding product showcase.
